Got it üëç
You want a card-based UI exactly like in the image, but with:

Your image at the top (from DB).

Below that ‚Üí description text (from DB).

Tags displayed like chips/pills.

A small Download button inside the card.


Here‚Äôs a ready Blackbox AI prompt you can paste, it will generate the UI in React + Tailwind (same modern look as your screenshot):

Prompt for Blackbox

Create a React component using Tailwind CSS that displays cards in a modern UI similar to the attached reference (dark theme with rounded cards, shadow, hover effect).  

Each card should have the following structure:  
1. Top: An image (fetched from DB).  
2. Below image: A description text (from DB).  
3. Tags: Display tags as rounded pill-shaped badges (from DB).  
4. A small "Download" button styled in neon/gradient inside the card bottom-right corner.  

The card design must look premium with smooth hover animation (slight scale-up and shadow glow).  
Use grid layout to display multiple cards.  
Ensure responsive design (cards adjust nicely for mobile, tablet, desktop).  

Fetch data from a placeholder JSON array like:  
```js
const data = [
  {
    id: 1,
    image: "https://via.placeholder.com/400",
    desc: "How We Revolutionize Customer Experience Using AR",
    tags: ["Case Study", "AR", "Customer"],
    download: "#"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    image: "https://via.placeholder.com/400",
    desc: "The Future of Marketing: Predictions for Next 5 Years",
    tags: ["Marketing", "Trends"],
    download: "#"
  }
];

Loop over this array to render cards dynamically.

‚ö° This will give you the **same UI style** but with your DB data, image, description, tags, and a download button.  

Do you want me to also **write the full React + Tailwind code** here so you can run it directly without editing?
